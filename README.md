## Abstract
In this master's thesis, we investigate the limiting Hessian eigenspectrum of neural network models featuring nonlinear activation functions. Our approach relies on the Bai-Silverstein analysis, exploiting concentration inequalities for specific quadratic forms for large random matrices. By relating these forms to the trace of the Hessian resolvent matrix, and thus its limiting Stieltjes transform, we establish a self-consistent equation for the latter. Solving this equation, we apply the Stieltjes inversion formula to reconstruct the limiting spectral density used for numerical simulations. This information sheds light on the loss landscape, e.g. the Hessian condition at random initialization of trainable parameters, and also during training.
